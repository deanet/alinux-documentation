Goodbye <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_new">wordpress</a>, welcome <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_new">Jekyll</a>.

Yeahh.. i really did this ...<br/>
I've spent time 2 days to understanding `Jekyll`, and almost four weeks which i've full coding on `Jekyll` and migration from wordpress. `Jekyll` is ruby framework web generator static. It's very wonderfull when u just need write documentation on your site. No `database`, no high pageload, simple editor using `vim` editor or others terminal editor, and just quick to `push`;).

Many ruby framework generator static like `Jekyll`, there are `blorgit`, `rassmalog`, etc. By using `Jekyll` u can use as on wordpress, `highlight` code using `python-pigments`, simple post using `markdown` convert `text` to `HTML`, editting on terminal editor, and at last you might try `git` solution. `Git` will update your post when you `push` on your repository, `jekyll` will generate automatically on `github` repository. Look at [github.com](http://github.com) if you interested to use `git`. 

I can't explain anymore about this migration because i;m not expert or advanced of `ruby` programming. Of course,.. you can bit the code of my site or repository on my [Github](http://github.com/alinuxwebid/alinuxwebid.github.com) account.

and at last ..

Might be you interested and you can start from [this](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blog-migrations) and [this](http://github.com).



Happy Coding ;)
